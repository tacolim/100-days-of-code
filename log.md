**Today's Progress**: More [Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.org/book) ; Worked on Loops & Lists

**Thoughts** Spent lots of time googling how to make a grocery list relying on raw_input & while loop (not part of assignment). I think that means I like it.

### Day 17: 2017 May 17, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: More work with [Programming for Everybody(Getting Started on Python) - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/welcome)

**Thoughts** 
I'm glad I decided to take this course. It's totally different from LPTHW and I like that I'm getting my knowledge from two different perspectives.

### Day 16: 2017 May 16, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: More [Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.org/book).

**Thoughts** 
One of the things I did today was debugging which was a lot of fun! (Does that make me weird?)

### Day 15: 2017 May 15, Monday
**Today's Progress**: More [Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.org/book).

**Thoughts** 
I did most of my work during the day while my baby was playing on the floor nearby, while this is possible it's not best practice because I got distracted a great deal.  I think I may try it a time or two more to see if I can figure out a way to work during the day.

### Day 14: 2017 May 14, Sunday - Happy Mother's Day!
**Today's Progress**: Began work on landing page for a project I'm working on with my husband.

**Thoughts** 
This is going to be a huuuuuuuuuuuuuge project. I'm not looking forward to all the grunt work, but I'm definitely looking foward to the end product.  That's the best thing about programming: seeing something you created functioning.

### Day 13: 2017 May 13, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: More [Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.org/book).  Made my own function for funsies.

**Thoughts** 
Today I realized that some day the number of days I have coded will one day diverge from the day of the month number. On that day I will be sad.
I think that I will do LPTHW most days, Programming for Everybody from Coursera 2 days a week and one day a week I will work on the personal project I've decided to tinker with.

### Day 12: 2017 May 12, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Started Working with [Programming for Everybody(Getting Started on Python) - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/welcome)

**Thoughts** 
This is a course I learned about from one of the other young women at the meetup that I attended on Wednesday.  I'm really glad that I went to the meetup because I was able to network and gain information and share information.

### Day 11: 2017 May 11, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: More [Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.org/book).

**Thoughts** 
I like that this book forces me to do lots of google searching and digging and reading.  It's not just handed over.  I have to look for information and think about what I'm learning.

### Day 6: 2017 May 06, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: More [Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.org/book)

**Thoughts** 
Feeling more comfortable jumping back and forth between terminal and my text editor. Love that feeling.
Also strangely thought I'd be more pumped to work on the weekend because my partner is home to help with the baby but instead had to force myself to work. I guess I got into "weekend mode" real hard.

### Day 5: 2017 May 05, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Started working with [Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.org/book)

**Thoughts** 
So far I am enjoying Python.  It seems very intuitive.  However, not sure I agree with the LPTHW author's methodologies all the time. 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I plan to keep moving forward with the resource and perhaps others for now.

### Day 4: 2017 May 04, Thursday - May the fourth be with you
**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC Basic JavaScript ; Started work on Codecademy's Python Track

**Thoughts** 
Decided to tinker with Python a bit, just the very basics, but so far I'm liking it.

### Day 3: 2017 May 03, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: More FCC Basic JavaScript ; Also checked out Codecademy's Learn JavaScript

**Thoughts** Tried to code a little during the day, difficult to concentrate with baby here.  Also difficult to concetrate when tired after baby is in bed for the night. Conundrum.

### Day 1: 2017 May 01, Monday - Happy Birthday to Me

**Today's Progress**: Failing at my attempt to brush up on the command line and Git.  Worked for half the time on Git/Command line & half the time on FCC Basic JavaScript.

**Thoughts** Glad I've decided to code everyday because my skill level has dropped off precipitously since I have been pursuing other things.
