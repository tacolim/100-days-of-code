# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2017 May 01, Monday - Happy Birthday to Me

**Today's Progress**: Failing at my attempt to brush up on the command line and Git.  Worked for half the time on Git/Command line & half the time on FCC Basic JavaScript.

**Thoughts** Glad I've decided to code everyday because my skill level has dropped off precipitously since I have been pursuing other things.

### Day 2: 2017 May 02, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: More FCC Basic JavaScript -- Loops

**Thoughts** For Loops, While Loops, Nested Loops... I'm feeling a little loopy.

### Day 3: 2017 May 03, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: More FCC Basic JavaScript ; Also checked out Codecademy's Learn JavaScript

**Thoughts** Tried to code a little during the day, difficult to concentrate with baby here.  Also difficult to concetrate when tired after baby is in bed for the night. Conundrum.

### Day 4: 2017 May 04, Thursday - May the fourth be with you
**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC Basic JavaScript ; Started work on Codecademy's Python Track

**Thoughts** 
Decided to tinker with Python a bit, just the very basics, but so far I'm liking it.
