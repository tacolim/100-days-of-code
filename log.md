# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: 2017 May 07, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Made a VERY simple MadLib which I'm working on for fun and practice with a friend from twitter.

**Thoughts** 
It felt great to produce something functional even if it is SUPER simple.

### Day 6: 2017 May 06, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: More [Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.org/book)

**Thoughts** 
Feeling more comfortable jumping back and forth between terminal and my text editor. Love that feeling.
Also strangely thought I'd be more pumped to work on the weekend because my partner is home to help with the baby but instead had to force myself to work. I guess I got into "weekend mode" real hard.

### Day 5: 2017 May 05, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Started working with [Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.org/book)

**Thoughts** 
So far I am enjoying Python.  It seems very intuitive.  However, not sure I agree with the LPTHW author's methodologies all the time. 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I plan to keep moving forward with the resource and perhaps others for now.

### Day 4: 2017 May 04, Thursday - May the fourth be with you
**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC Basic JavaScript ; Started work on Codecademy's Python Track

**Thoughts** 
Decided to tinker with Python a bit, just the very basics, but so far I'm liking it.

### Day 3: 2017 May 03, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: More FCC Basic JavaScript ; Also checked out Codecademy's Learn JavaScript

**Thoughts** Tried to code a little during the day, difficult to concentrate with baby here.  Also difficult to concetrate when tired after baby is in bed for the night. Conundrum.

### Day 1: 2017 May 01, Monday - Happy Birthday to Me

**Today's Progress**: Failing at my attempt to brush up on the command line and Git.  Worked for half the time on Git/Command line & half the time on FCC Basic JavaScript.

**Thoughts** Glad I've decided to code everyday because my skill level has dropped off precipitously since I have been pursuing other things.
