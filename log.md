# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2017 May 01, Monday - Happy Birthday to Me

**Today's Progress**: Failing at my attempt to brush up on the command line and Git.  Worked for half the time on Git/Command line & half the time on FCC Basic JavaScript.

**Thoughts** Glad I've decided to code everyday because my skill level has dropped off precipitously since I have been pursuing other things.
